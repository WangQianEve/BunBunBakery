# BunBunBakery
Project 1, Assignment 5 of SSUI.

[Online Store of BunBun Bakery](https://wangqianeve.github.io/BunBunBakery).

### Requirements

A user should be able to: 

1. Open your site to the home page ([welcome page](https://wangqianeve.github.io/BunBunBakery/))

2. Start browsing through products : click sign-in button.

3. Select a product, and see more details about that product: click on any product

4. Select how many of the product they’d like: use the selector on top-right.

5. Select among product options like color/size (product options detailed in 

   HW2 for each of your clients): There’s no option for cinnamon rolls.

6. Add a product to their bag/cart through a button: click “add to cart” button from either detail page, or home page, and you can change amount or delete from the cart.



### My concern

I’m mostly concerned with sizes when I’m implementing it. In my sketch design, I have a fixed window size. But when implementing it, I start to worry about responsiveness.  

The only thing I changed was the customize panel. I finally make it a filter, but simply because I think a filter can serve more.



### Resources

- I used Bootstrap, a little jQuery, AngularJs and Sass for this website, so I learned from some examples and documentations of their website or W3School.
- Pictures are from google image search.
- Some descriptions of the rolls are from a website called “[Cinnabon](https://www.cinnabon.com/bakery-menu/)”
